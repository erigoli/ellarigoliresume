    		As an investment banking summer intern, I gained valuable experience working in a fast-paced environment where professionalism and attention to detail were paramount. As a co-founder of a nonprofit organization, I acquired skills such as diligent planning, peer outreach, corporate formation, fundraising, and marketing. As a college student, I demonstrate determination, creativity, and excellent time-management skills. As a college athlete, I have learned how to work with a team and be a leader. Additionally, I am proficient in Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, financial modeling, and valuation.
